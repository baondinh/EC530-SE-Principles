# Assignment 1
- User of module are other developers
- Mission of module: If user gives input of two arrays of geo location, match each point in the first array to the closest one in the second array
- To find the distance between two GPS locations, use Haversine Formula for precise straight-line distance that accounts for Earth's curvature

a = sin^2^

Prompt: "Give me the LaTeX snippet for the Haversine Formula to calculate GPS coordinate distance. I am including this formula in a README.md file"
 
$$
d = 2R \arcsin\!\left(
\sqrt{
\sin^2\!\left(\frac{\varphi_2 - \varphi_1}{2}\right)
+
\cos(\varphi_1)\cos(\varphi_2)
\sin^2\!\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right)
}
\right)
